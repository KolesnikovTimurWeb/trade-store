            <h2>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA

            </h2>
            <p>The company Tradingbrokerpicker complies with applicable legal regulations when using users' personal
               data. The company is registered as a Data Controller with the Office of the Commissioner for Personal
               Data Protection in accordance with Directive 2016/680 of the European Union on the processing of personal
               data and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
               personal data and on the free movement of such data. Personal data will be processed by the Company in
               accordance with the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Trading Terms of the Company.
               The company collects personal data and establishes the purposes, conditions, and methods of their
               processing, which makes it a data controller. A data processor is a natural or legal person who processes
               personal data on behalf of the controller. When filling out an online application for a real or demo
               account, forms of another type, or using any other service that the Company provides through its website,
               the Company will collect and store personal data about the user. When filling out any application or
               requested form, the user provides personal information necessary to evaluate the request/application and
               comply with laws and regulations governing the provision of Forex/CFD services and/or any other financial
               instruments. This information may also be used to communicate with the user regarding the Company's
               services if they have consented to this during the registration process.
               The company conducts a registration process on its website to collect documents verifying the identity of
               potential clients in accordance with the company's internal policies and procedures. This allows the
               company to assess the possibility of business relationships with the potential client. The company
               collects personal data of each potential client and uses it only for evaluation and storage in electronic
               or physical form on the company's disk, server, and files in its premises. Such data is processed only
               for collection purposes, such as determining potential business relationships, marketing, evaluating
               services provided by the company, and other purposes related to the aforementioned reasons. The company
               collects certain personal data to meet the needs of customers through the efficient provision of
               services. This also allows the company to monitor and improve services for its current and future
               clients.
