            </h2>
            <p>To take advantage of any investment opportunity that can generate income, Tradingbrokerpicker Trading
               clients must deposit funds into their online account. If there is profit, it can be withdrawn from the
               account at any time.
               Deposit and withdrawal operations are controlled by the WD policy as well as the general terms and
               conditions</p>

            <p>To make deposits into your trading account, as a client, you must use only one source (for example, a
               single bank account). Prior to trading, it is necessary to ensure that the trading account is registered

               authentic SWIFT confirmation must be provided to Tradingbrokerpicker Trading. Failure to comply with the
               WD policy may result in a ban on depositing funds via bank or wire transfers. If you have not logged in
               and traded from your account for a period of three (3) months, monthly fees of 10% will be deducted from
               your account

            <h2>WITHDRAWALS
            </h2>
            <p>The withdrawal of funds must be made to the same bank account or credit/debit card that was used for the
               deposit, in accordance with generally accepted rules and regulations. Unless otherwise agreed beforehand,
               withdrawals from the Account can only be made in the same currency as the corresponding deposit. When
               using alternative payment methods for depositing or withdrawing funds for trading purposes, the Client
               must take into account possible additional commissions and restrictions. A processing and withdrawal fee
               will be charged for withdrawals, which will be deducted from the withdrawn amount. The commission
               schedule is available on Tradingbrokerpicker Trading. Tradingbrokerpicker Trading may withdraw funds to a
               different instrument than the one used for deposit if it complies with anti-money laundering rules. In
               addition, the client may be asked to provide additional information and documents when withdrawing funds.
               Please note that if the above rules and regulations are followed, fund withdrawals occur smoothly and
               without delay</p>
